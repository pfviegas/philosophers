The "Philosophers" project is a classic concurrency exercise, focusing on thread and process management, synchronization, and resource sharing. The program simulates the famous Dining Philosophers Problem, where philosophers alternate between thinking, eating, and sleeping around a table with a limited number of forks (resources).

The main goals are to:

- Correctly implement thread and/or process creation
- Prevent deadlocks and starvation
- Synchronize access to shared resources (forks) using mutexes (mandatory) or semaphores (bonus)
